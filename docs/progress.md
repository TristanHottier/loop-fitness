# Progress

Milestone checklist. The orchestrator updates this file at the end of each milestone.
Definition of done for each milestone is taken from `docs/fitness-app-brief.md` (section 10).

## M0: Repo, scaffold, deploy
Done when: an empty installable PWA is live on Cloudflare Pages and opens on the phone.

- [x] Vite + React + TypeScript scaffold in `app/`
- [x] PWA: web manifest, service worker, installable on Android (Chrome)
- [x] App shell: bottom nav (Today, Plan, Progress, Settings) with placeholder screens
- [x] Design tokens: dark default, light available (section 9)
- [x] Cloudflare Pages deploy config
- [x] Deployed to Cloudflare Pages (project `loop-fitness`, production branch `main`)
- [ ] Verified on the phone (user to confirm it opens and is installable)
- [x] Reviewer pass (M0 review: PASS, no violations)

Status: deployed live, awaiting phone verification

## M1: Plan and exercise pages
Done when: the three workouts and every exercise page render from `plan.json`, with YouTube embeds and gallery images.

- [x] `plan.json` generated from `content/` (3 workouts, 21 exercises, band ladders, overrides for supersets)
- [x] Gallery folders `app/public/gallery/<exercise-slug>/` (21) + `media.json` (21 slugs, ready for user content)
- [x] Plan screen: three workouts, each exercise opens its page
- [x] Exercise page: written instructions, YouTube embed (privacy-enhanced), gallery images
- [x] Offline: `plan.json` and `media.json` precached by the service worker
- [x] Reviewer pass (M1 review: all items PASS after the offline precache fix)

Status: complete, awaiting deploy and user content (YouTube links, gallery pictures)
